3d avatars are increasingly used for platforms such as social media, virtual assistants, and digital worlds. They provide a digital representation, allowing for immersive experiences for users.

The primary goal of this project is to create avatars that represent different users within a shopping application. This is achieved by providing a variety of customization options which can be dynamically changed over time. This provides users with the ability to create their own personal brand through the avatars created.
